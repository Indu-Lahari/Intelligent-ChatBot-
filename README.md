# Intelligent Chatbot with ChatGPT and PyQt

## Description
This project involves building an intelligent chatbot using ChatGPT from OpenAI and a graphical user interface (GUI) with PyQt. The chatbot can interact with users in real-time, providing responses generated by the ChatGPT model.

## Process
1. **Setup**: Installed necessary libraries and configured OpenAI API.
2. **GUI Design**: Created the chatbot interface using PyQt, including a chat display area, input field, and send button.
3. **Backend Integration**: Developed a backend script to handle user inputs, send them to the OpenAI API, and display the responses in the GUI.
4. **Threading**: Implemented threading to ensure the GUI remains responsive during interactions.

## Technology Used
- **Python**: The core programming language for the project.
- **PyQt6**: Used for creating the graphical user interface.
- **OpenAI API**: Powered the chatbot with ChatGPT.
- **Threading**: Ensured smooth and responsive user interactions.

## What I Learned from This Project
- **PyQt GUI Development**: Gained experience in designing and implementing a functional GUI using PyQt.
- **API Integration**: Learned how to integrate and interact with external APIs, specifically OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT API.
- **Threading in Python**: Understood the basics of threading to improve the responsiveness of applications.
- **Chatbot Logic**: Developed a basic understanding of how chatbots work and how to enhance user experience through UI/UX design.

## Future Insights
- **Improved UI/UX**: Plan to enhance the GUI for a more user-friendly experience.
- **Additional Features**: Integrate features like saving chat history, voice input/output, and customizable themes.
- **Advanced AI Models**: Explore the use of more advanced AI models and techniques to improve the chatbot's performance.
- **Deployment**: Look into deploying the chatbot as a web or desktop application for wider accessibility.

## Usage
To run the chatbot, execute the `main.py` file. Ensure you have all dependencies installed and the OpenAI API key configured.
